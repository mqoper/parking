<h4>Registering a Slack account with the <b>/register</b> command</h4>
<p>
  To register a Slack account in this app you need to register a regular account first: <b>Log in > Sign up</b>.
  When registering, you need to write a six-character "Slack register",
  this is the id by which you will be able to associate your Slack account with the account in the application.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've registered an in-app account, you'll need to accept the Slack "Pro" invitation.
  To associate your account with a previously registered account in the application, you must enter the command <b>/register (slack register)</b> ,
  where (slack register) is the six-character "Slack register" entered during registration.
  If everything goes correctly, you will receive the message "The account has been registered with (account name)"

  If you do not register a Slack account,
  all reserved parking spots will be assigned to the (Unverified user) and any logged in user will be able to delete this reservation.

<h4>Reservation of parking spots with Slack <b>/book</b> command </h4>

  If the spot is properly reserved, you will receive an answer "User (account name) reserved spot (name of spot)".
